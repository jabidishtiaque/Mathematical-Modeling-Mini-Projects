# Mathematical-Modeling-Projects

I have worked on numerous small and couple of large scale Mathematical Modeling projects during my studies. Most of them revolved around modeling some physical system in terms of mathematical equations and perform operations like Optimization or solving the system parameters for some boundary conditions or trying to predict future behaviors etc. I try to explore new ideas and try out small projects myself from time to time and I'll be eventually adding all my past and upcoming Mathematical modeling related projects in this repo.


### Tools:
